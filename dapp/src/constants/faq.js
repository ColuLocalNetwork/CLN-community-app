    question: 'What is the Fuse chain and how it helps my community?',
    answer: 'The Fuse chain is a public payments network bridged to Ethereum. The Fuse chain allows entrepreneurs to create communities on the Blockchain using an easy to use tool for community managers called the Fuse Studio.  Using the Fuse Studio, entrepreneurs can create a community entirely governed on the Blockcahin with permission managements, token issuance, and tap into powerful business logic and service providers. Using the Studio, the entrepreneur issues a standard token (ERC-20) on the Etheruem Mainnet and using the bridge to move the asset to the Fuse chain for much cheaper and faster transactions (Read here to learn more). The Fuse chain can support any type of coin existing on Ethereum and other blockchains in the future. Entrepreneurs that use the bridge to move to the Fuse chain will be able to add new functionality to their token with almost no effort including adding the token to a white label wallet or manage it distribution. All of those tools are out of the box and free to use on the Fuse chain.'

    question: 'What types of communities can i create with the studio?',
    answer: `The Fuse studio community launch wizard provides the following options for enterpreneues:
    - A mintable burnable token - This option creates a community around a token that can be issued and burned by community manager. This is intended to act as an IOU inside a specific community. Usually with tokens like this the issuer (who is you) is providing the backing and the convertibility for the coin so this is intended for small scale communities and more advanced users. This token has no cap and any amount could be created or destroyed.
    
    - One time issuance - This option creates a token similar to Bitcoin. As it has only 
    
    - Existing tokens - Community manager don't necessarily need to be the issuer of their own currency and they can use any compatible existing currencies like DAI, USDC or any other stable coin on Ethereum. We added DAI as the first stable coin to integrate to Fuse with many more to come soon! The Dai is added as the default currency of the community and can be used on the Fuse chain and as a part of you community with almost no effort.`
